- **Effort:** 700-1,000 LOC

**Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (Week 7)**
- Unit tests, integration tests
- Security testing
- Documentation
- **Effort:** 500-800 LOC

### Blockers Identified

1. **Async Initialization vs Synchronous SWT API** (CRITICAL)
   - **Impact:** SWT expects synchronous creation: `new Browser(parent).SetUrl(url)`
   - **Reality:** All platforms use async: `await webView.EnsureCoreWebView2Async()`
   - **Mitigation:** Deferred initialization with `Initialized` event, operation queuing
   - **Status:** Architectural challenge - breaks SWT compatibility
   - **Risk:** User experience issues, unexpected behavior

2. **External Runtime Dependencies** (CRITICAL)
   - **Win10:** WebView2 Runtime not guaranteed (120+ MB if not present)
   - **Win11:** Pre-installed (no issue)
   - **Win7:** NOT SUPPORTED (WebView2 incompatible)
   - **Linux:** webkit2gtk library often missing
   - **Mitigation:** Bundle installer, document prerequisites
   - **Status:** Deployment complexity, larger distribution
   - **Risk:** Installation failures, user frustration

3. **Objective-C Bridge Complexity** (CRITICAL - macOS)
   - **Impact:** WKWebView requires extensive Objective-C integration
   - **Mitigation:** Runtime class creation, protocol implementation
   - **Status:** Extremely complex, highest risk component
   - **Risk:** Runtime crashes, memory leaks

4. **JavaScript Bridge Implementation** (HIGH)
   - **Impact:** Different APIs per platform, type marshaling, async returns
   - **Mitigation:** Unified abstraction layer, careful type conversion
   - **Status:** Complex but feasible

5. **Security Vulnerabilities** (CRITICAL)
   - **Impact:** XSS, malicious JavaScript, data exfiltration
   - **Mitigation:** CSP headers, input sanitization, security audits
   - **Status:** Requires security expertise
   - **Risk:** Potential security incidents

6. **Testing Challenges** (HIGH)
   - **Impact:** Hard to automate browser testing
   - **Mitigation:** Manual testing, limited automation
   - **Status:** Time-consuming, incomplete coverage

### Effort Estimate
- **Development:** 32.5 days (260 hours)
- **LOC:** 3,200-4,800 new lines
- **Cost:** $26,000-39,000

### Why Defer?

**Complexity:** 16-20× more effort than typical widgets (260h vs 8-16h)

**External Dependencies:** Requires runtime installations, deployment complexity

**Architectural Conflict:** Async APIs fundamentally conflict with synchronous SWT model

**Not Foundational:** No other widgets depend on Browser widget

**High Risk:** Could block progress on simpler, more essential features

**Low ROI:** Most desktop apps don't need embedded browser

### Recommendation: **STRONGLY DEFER** ❌

**Priority 1-5 features** provide much higher ROI with lower risk:
- Testing ensures quality
- Graphics/Events/Layouts are foundational
- DND is complex but well-understood

**If Browser critically needed:**
- Implement Windows WebView2 version ONLY first
- Mark as "experimental" or "Windows-only"
- Limited API (basic URL loading, simple JavaScript)
- Add macOS/Linux later (months/years)

**Timeline:** Revisit after 3-6 months when core features are stable and proven.
