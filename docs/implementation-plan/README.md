## 📊 Current Status

**Overall Progress:** ~15% complete (foundation phase)

### Completed ✅
- Core infrastructure (Widget, Control, Display, Shell)
- Basic widget stubs (Button, Label, Text)
- Event system foundation
- Platform abstraction layer
- Windows platform (partial implementation)

### In Progress 🚧
- **Phase 1**: Completing basic widgets (Button, Label, Text)
  - Windows implementation: ~60%
  - macOS implementation: ~5% (stubs)
  - Linux implementation: ~5% (stubs)

### Not Started ⚪
- **Phase 2**: Composite foundation (CRITICAL - blocks most other work)
- **Phases 3-12**: All subsequent phases

---

## 🎯 Immediate Priorities

### This Week
1. Complete Phase 1 planning and task breakdown
2. Set up CI/CD for all three platforms
3. Establish coding standards and review process
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation (complete basic widgets)

### This Month
1. Complete Phase 1 (basic widgets on all platforms)
2. Start Phase 2 (Composite - CRITICAL PATH)
3. Achieve platform parity for basic widgets
4. Establish weekly sync meetings

### This Quarter
1. Complete Phase 2 (Composite)
2. Complete Phase 3 (Layouts)
3. Start Phase 4 (Graphics) and Phase 6 (Complex widgets)
4. Reach 40-50% completion milestone

---

## 📈 Timeline Estimates

### Sequential Development (3 developers)
- **Duration**: 12-15 months
- **Approach**: Phase by phase, Windows → macOS → Linux
- **Risk**: Slow progress, platform divergence

### Balanced Development (6-8 developers)
- **Duration**: 8-10 months
- **Approach**: Moderate parallelization, concurrent platform work
- **Risk**: Medium coordination overhead
- **Recommended** ✅

### Optimal Development (14-15 developers)
- **Duration**: 6 months
- **Approach**: Maximum parallelization, dedicated platform teams
- **Risk**: High coordination overhead, expensive
